Dear Mr./Ms,
It is my pleasure to write here for you.

I am a business user of laposte .I am writing to enquire about SLS:

1. My account number 837127, when receiver country in EU and insured value is not empty always failed,  product code is 'BOM' and 'DOM', the error code is 30309 ,message is The insured value option is incorrect

2. My other account 822038 for downloading invoices, I hope that invoice has other formats just like EXCEL and TXT.

Thank you for your kind cooperation.
